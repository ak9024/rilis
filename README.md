## Key Features

- Effortless VM (Virtual Machine) Deployment
- Simply configure with a file `deploy.toml` or `anything.toml` and use `docker-compose.yaml` locally.


## Installation

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/ak9024/rilis
```

Create configuration named `deploy.toml`.

```toml

password = ""
# Your private_key location
private_key = "/Users/adiatma/.ssh/id_ed25519"
# by default port 22, but you can customize by your self.
port = 22

[server]
# scp is optional, if do you want to copying to file from local to the server, can be define here.
scp = [ "docker-compose.yaml" ]
# ssh commands if do you want to exec script or anything on the server.
commands = [
  "sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d",
  "sudo docker ps",
]
```
